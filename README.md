# README.md

## code
Since our group coded everything in the jupyter notebook, no functions/ code will be included in this folder - specifically no scripts were made for code to run. 
## data

The data sets used were ch130.tsp and tsp225.tsp. Since no changes were made on the data sets both the interim and processed folders contain both of this data sets. The raw folder contains not only the previous data sets mentioned but also others that contain the results of the tuning of the parameters for the genetic algorithm.

## docs

### figures
It contains all figures that appear in the thesis, all of which are taken out of the jupyter notebooks (so they can be found there as well). 
### reports
Our group didn't do any reports so this tab is empty.
### thesis
Contains the thesis made in LateX, where all the results, comments and figures appear. 
## notebooks
Contains several different notebooks and fucntions, related to different algorithms used:
- 1.0-FilipaCosta-Genetic-Algorithm.ipynb
- 2.0-FilipaCosta-GA-DataAnalysis.ipynb
Both of these are related to the genetic algorithm.  1.0-FilipaCosta-Genetic-Algorithm.ipynb has the code for the algorithm (with a small analysis of the results) and 2.0-FilipaCosta-GA-DataAnalysis.ipynb has all the comments, graphics and results. All of this is better explained in the notebooks.
- 3.0-CatarinaRodrigues-NN.ipynb.ipynb

This is related to the nearest neighbour algorithm. It has the results, graphics and comments.

- 4.0gr-antcolonyoptimizer.ipynb
- AntColonyOptimizer.py

This is related to the ant colony optimizer algorithm. 4.0gr-antcolonyoptimizer.ipynb has the results, comments and graphics. The AntColonyOptimizer.py is the implemented function. It is included in this folder to be less confusing.

### How to make them work

For the 1.0-FilipaCosta-Genetic-Algorithm.ipynb, 2.0-FilipaCosta-GA-DataAnalysis.ipynb and 3.0-CatarinaRodrigues-NN.ipynb.ipynb all that's needed is to put the data sets, ch130 and tsp225, in the same folder as these notebooks and run them. For the 4.0gr-antcolonyoptimizer.ipynb both the data sets and the AntColonyOptimizer.py need to be in the folder for it to run.

## references
Since all references are already included in the thesis file, this folder will be empty.
