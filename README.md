The report should formulate the problem to be solved, explain
the methods used, and compare the results obtained using proper metrics. 

The chosen problem was the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Given a set of n cities and the distances between each pair of them, the traveling salesman
problem, or TSP for short, consists of finding a roundtrip of minimal length visiting each city
exactly once.
The following site (TSPLIB) contains TSP, ATSP, SOP and CVRP: (http://comopt.ifi.uniheidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/). 
Two benchmarks of TSP problems were chosen from the
database, one with about 100 nodes and another with at least 200 nodes.

The problems were solved using Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization and Nearest Neighbors and the results compared.
